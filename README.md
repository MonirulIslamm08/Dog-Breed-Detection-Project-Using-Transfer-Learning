# 🐶 Dog Breed Detection | Transfer Learning

A deep learning project to identify dog breeds from images using transfer learning with pre-trained CNN models.

## 🎯 Objective
Build a robust image classification model to detect dog breeds with high accuracy using transfer learning (e.g., MobileNetV2, EfficientNet).

## 📁 Project Structure
```
├── dog_breed_detection.ipynb     # Main notebook
├── static/                       # Static files (if Flask frontend is used)
├── templates/                    # HTML files for frontend
├── model/                        # Saved model files
└── app.py                        # Flask app (optional)
```

## 🚀 Features
- Classifies multiple dog breeds from images
- Utilizes pre-trained models (e.g., MobileNetV2, EfficientNet)
- Fast training and high accuracy
- Optional Flask-based frontend for demo

## 🧠 Tech Stack
